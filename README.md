## Here are two classification methods.
KNN and LDA both based on Iris dataset.
divided the dataset into two parts and shuffled, half for training and half for testing.

In LDA, the "class" of three Iris can be label as '0','1','2'. It is based on what you want to do, 2-class problem or multi-class problem.

reference
The main part of LDA is from the reference below. I just did some fix to change the way to input dataset(pre-process).

Put your data set in the same folder when you run this code. This two methods did not use ready-made tools like scikit-learn.

Hope it helps you:).
